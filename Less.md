# Less Basic Tutorial

##  Home

LESS is a CSS pre-processor that enables customizable, manageable and reusable style sheet for website.

LESS is a dynamic style sheet language that extends the capability of CSS.

LESS is also cross browser friendly.

## Less - Overview

CSS Preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS and gets compiled into regular CSS syntax, so that it can be read by your web browser.

It provides functionalities like *variables*, *functions*, *mixins* and *operations* that allow you to build dynamic CSS.

### Why LESS?

Let us now understand why do we use LESS.

- LESS supports creating cleaner, cross-browser friendly CSS faster and easier.
- LESS is designed in JavaScript and also created to be used in *live*, which compiles faster than other CSS pre-processors.
- LESS keeps your code in modular way which is really important by making it readable and easily changeable.
- Faster maintenance can be achieved by the use of LESS *variables*.

### History

LESS was designed by **Alexis Sellier** in 2009. 

LESS is an open-source. The first version of LESS was written in Ruby; in the later versions, the use of Ruby was replaced by JavaScript.

### Features

- Cleaner and more readable code can be written in an organized way.
- We can define styles and it can be reused throughout the code.
- LESS is based on JavaScript and is a super set of CSS.
- LESS is an agile tool that sorts out the problem of code redundancy.

### Advantages

- LESS easily generates CSS that works across the browsers.
- LESS enables you to write better and well-organized code by using *nesting*.
- Maintenance can be achieved faster by the use of *variables*.
- LESS enables you to reuse the whole classes easily by referencing them in your rule sets.
- LESS provides the use of *operations* that makes coding faster and saves time.

### Disadvantages

- It takes time to learn if you are new to CSS preprocessing.
- Due to the tight coupling between the modules, more efforts should be taken to reuse and/or test dependent modules.
- LESS has less framework compared to older preprocessor like SASS, which consists of frameworks *Compass*, *Gravity* and *Susy*.
